Boris Bikes
=======

This was a project in which we were asked to design a system of boris bikes using ruby classes and modules. The main aim of this project was to allow us total newcomers to object oriented programming to grasp the concepts of it and of TDD.

Technologies used include:
-----------------------
  - ruby
  - rspec


How to use: 
-------------
1. Git clone repo 
2. require each file in lib in pry/irb
3. initialize your modules and begin your boris bike adventure!
